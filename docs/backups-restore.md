# Restore the cluster from a previously saved backup

The Operator supports the ability to perform a full restore on a PostgreSQL
cluster as well as a point-in-time-recovery. There are two ways to
restore a cluster:

* restore to a new cluster using the [dataSource.postgresCluster](operator.md#datasource-postgrescluster-clustername)
subsection,
* restore in-place to an existing cluster (note that this is destructive) using
the [backups.restore](operator.md#backups-restore-enabled) subsection.

## Restore to a new PostgreSQL cluster

Restoring to a new PostgreSQL cluster allows you to take a backup and create a
new PostgreSQL cluster that can run alongside an existing one. There are several
scenarios where using this technique is helpful:

* Creating a copy of a PostgreSQL cluster that can be used for other purposes.
Another way of putting this is *creating a clone*.
* Restore to a point-in-time and inspect the state of the data without affecting
the current cluster.

To create a new PostgreSQL cluster from either the active one, or a former cluster
whose pgBackRest repository still exists, use the [dataSource.postgresCluster](operator.md#datasource-postgrescluster-clustername) subsection options. The content of this subsection
should copy the `backups` keys of the original cluster - ones needed to carry on
the restore:

* `dataSource.postgresCluster.clusterName` should contain the new cluster name,
* `dataSource.postgresCluster.options` allow you to set the needed pgBackRest
    command line options,
* `dataSource.postgresCluster.repoName` should contain the name of the
    pgBackRest repository, while the actual storage configuration keys for this
    repository should be placed into `dataSource.pgbackrest.repo` subsection,
* `dataSource.pgbackrest.configuration.secret.name` should contain the name of
    a Kubernetes Secret with credentials needed to access cloud storage, if any.
    
## Restore to an existing PostgreSQL cluster

To restore the previously saved backup, use a *backup restore*
configuration file. The example of the backup configuration file is
[deploy/restore.yaml](https://github.com/percona/percona-postgresql-operator/blob/main/deploy/restore.yaml):

```yaml
apiVersion: pg.percona.com/v2beta1
kind: PerconaPGRestore
metadata:
  name: restore1
spec:
  pgCluster: cluster1
  repoName: repo1
  options:
  - --type=time
  - --target="2022-11-30 15:12:11+03"
```

The following keys are the most important ones:

* `pgCluster` specifies the name of your cluster,
* `repoName` specifies the name of one of the 4 pgBackRest repositories,
    already configured in the `backups.pgbackrest.repos` subsection,
* `options` passes through any [pgBackRest command line options](https://pgbackrest.org/configuration.html).

To start the restoration process, run the following command:

``` {.bash data-prompt="$" }
$ kubectl apply -f deploy/restore.yaml
```

## Restore the cluster with point-in-time recovery

Point-in-time recovery functionality allows users to revert the database back to
a state before an unwanted change had occurred.

!!! note

    For this feature to work, the Operator initiates a full backup 
    immediately after the cluster creation, to use it as a basis for
    point-in-time recovery when needed (this backup is not listed in the output
    of the `kubectl get pg-backup` command).

You can set up a point-in-time recovery using the normal restore command of
pgBackRest with few additional `spec.options` fields in `deploy/restore.yaml`:

* set `--type` option to `time`,
* set `--target` to a specific time you would like to restore to. You can use
the typical string formatted as `<YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:DD>`, optionally followed
by a timezone offset: `"2021-04-16 15:13:32+00"` (`+00` in the above
example means UTC),
* optional `--set` argument allows you to choose the backup which will be the
starting point for point-in-time recovery. You can look through the available backups
with the `kubectl get pg-backup` command to find out the proper backup name.
This option must be specified if the target is one or more backups away from the
current moment.

After setting these options in the *backup restore* configuration file,
follow the standard restore instructions.

!!! note

    Make sure you have a backup that is older than your desired point in time.
    You obviously canâ€™t restore from a time where you do not have a backup.
    All relevant write-ahead log files must be successfully pushed before you
    make the restore.
